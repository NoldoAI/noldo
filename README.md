## Problems

### From the Seller’s Perspective

1. **Identifying Buyers:**  
   Sellers often struggle to pinpoint active buyers, missing out on potential leads.
   
2. **Engagement and Persuasion:**  
   Effectively communicating product value and differentiating from competitors remains challenging.
   
3. **Resource Constraints:**  
   Manual lead generation and follow-up consume valuable time and resources.
   
4. **Localized Targeting:**  
   Reaching buyers in specific regions (e.g., Georgia) is difficult without advanced targeting tools.
   
5. **Standing Out in Competitive Markets:**  
   In crowded sectors like electronics, attracting attention is a persistent challenge.

### From the Buyer’s Perspective

1. **Pinpointing the Perfect Product:**  
   Finding the exact product that meets specific criteria (like price, specs, and locality) is often frustrating.
   
2. **Inefficient Search Processes:**  
   Manually sifting through multiple channels to locate deals wastes time.
   
3. **Trust and Reliability Issues:**  
   Assessing seller credibility can be hard, especially with high-value or tech products.
   
4. **Missing Out on Deals:**  
   Buyers frequently overlook limited-time offers and price drops due to ineffective monitoring.
   
5. **Overwhelming Options:**  
   A flood of unfiltered choices can paralyze decision-making.
   
6. **Local Shopping Barriers:**  
   Buyers may struggle with high shipping costs or non-local sellers.
   
7. **Generic Recommendations:**  
   Standardized suggestions often miss the mark, leaving buyers without personalized advice.

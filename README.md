# SeekDeep

## Problem
- **Sellers** want to find people who want to buy their products.
- **Sellers** want to communicate and convince potential buyers.

## Our Solution
- **Finding Buyers**: We identify people who want to buy specific products on social media.
- **AI Sales Assistant**: Our AI sales assistant, which has access to the seller's database, communicates with potential buyers and tries to convince them to make a purchase (or follows any other instructions provided by the seller).

## Platform Features for Sellers
- **Create AI Sales Assistant**: Sellers can create an AI sales assistant with specific instructions on how to communicate with clients.
- **Product List & Descriptions**: Sellers can create a list of products and provide descriptions to help the AI assistant communicate effectively.

## Lead Generation
- **Social Media Monitoring**: The system identifies potential leads on social media. For example, if someone posts on Facebook about wanting to buy an iPhone in Georgia, our bot will send a comment like: 
  > "We're selling iPhones, come and check, ask me any questions - https://{seller}.deepseek/iphone-for-sale"
  
  On this link, the buyer will interact with the AI assistant bot that has knowledge about the product.

## Platform Features for Buyers
- **Monitoring Seller Websites**: We constantly monitor sellers' websites, such as those selling electronics, and save their data.
- **SeekDeep Chat**: Buyers can use the SeekDeep chat to ask for products. For example:
  > "I'm in Georgia and I want to buy a Mac Pro."
  
  The AI will provide links and options from sellers and social media.
- **Alerts**: Buyers can set alerts for specific products and prices. For example:
  > "If someone lists an iPhone 15 under 2000 Lari, send me an alert."

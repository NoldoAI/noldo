## Problems (Sellers' Perspective)
1. **Finding Buyers:**  
   Sellers struggle to identify and reach potential buyers who are actively looking for their products.  

2. **Engaging and Convincing Buyers:**  
   Sellers find it challenging to communicate effectively with potential buyers and convince them to make a purchase.  

3. **Time and Resource Constraints:**  
   Manual lead generation and customer interaction are time-consuming and require significant resources.  

4. **Localized Targeting:**  
   Sellers targeting specific regions (e.g., Georgia) often face difficulties in finding local buyers.  

5. **Competition:**  
   Sellers in competitive markets (e.g., electronics) need tools to stand out and connect with buyers quickly.

## Problems (Buyers' Perspective)
1. **Finding the Right Product:**  
   Buyers often struggle to find the exact product they are looking for, especially in specific regions or at a desired price point.  

2. **Time-Consuming Search:**  
   Manually searching through multiple websites, social media platforms, and marketplaces to find the best deals is time-consuming and inefficient.  

3. **Lack of Trustworthy Sellers:**  
   Buyers may find it difficult to identify reliable sellers, especially when purchasing high-value items like electronics.  

4. **Missing Out on Deals:**  
   Buyers often miss out on limited-time offers, discounts, or price drops because they are not actively monitoring the market.  

5. **Overwhelming Options:**  
   With so many sellers and platforms available, buyers can feel overwhelmed by the number of choices and struggle to make a decision.  

6. **Localized Shopping Challenges:**  
   Buyers in specific regions (e.g., Georgia) may have difficulty finding sellers who offer products locally or at reasonable shipping costs.  

7. **Lack of Personalized Recommendations:**  
   Buyers often receive generic or irrelevant product suggestions, making it harder to find what they truly need.

## Our Solution
- **Finding Buyers**: We identify people who want to buy specific products on social media.
- **AI Sales Assistant**: Our AI sales assistant, which has access to the seller's database, communicates with potential buyers and tries to convince them to make a purchase (or follows any other instructions provided by the seller).

---

## Platform Features for Sellers
- **Create AI Sales Assistant**: Sellers can create an AI sales assistant with specific instructions on how to communicate with clients.
- **Product List & Descriptions**: Sellers can create a list of products and provide descriptions to help the AI assistant communicate effectively.

---

## Lead Generation
- **Social Media Monitoring**: The system identifies potential leads on social media. For example, if someone posts on Facebook about wanting to buy an iPhone in Georgia, our bot will send a comment like:  
  > "We're selling iPhones, come and check, ask me any questions - https://{seller}.deepseek/iphone-for-sale"
  
  On this link, the buyer will interact with the AI assistant bot that has knowledge about the product.

---

## Platform Features for Buyers
- **Monitoring Seller Websites**: We constantly monitor sellers' websites, such as those selling electronics, and save their data.
- **SeekDeep Chat**: Buyers can use the SeekDeep chat to ask for products. For example:
  > "I'm in Georgia and I want to buy a Mac Pro."
  
  The AI will provide links and options from sellers and social media.
- **Alerts**: Buyers can set alerts for specific products and prices. For example:
  > "If someone lists an iPhone 15 under 2000 Lari, send me an alert."

- **Gather and Analyze Data**: Collect insights on customer preferences, frequently asked questions, and product demand.
- **Enhance In-Store Experience**: Improve customer satisfaction by offering quick and relevant information, reducing wait times, and assisting sales representatives.

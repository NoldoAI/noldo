### 🚀 **Startup Pitch: "Seeky"**

**What’s the idea?**
Think about this—people on Reddit complain **all the time** about products, apps, and services. Reddit’s literally full of people saying exactly what's annoying, missing, or broken in their daily lives.

Now imagine a simple tool—powered by AI—that scans all these conversations, spots the biggest frustrations or problems, and automatically tells you, "Hey, here’s a perfect business opportunity you could start right now." That's exactly what Seeky does.

### 📌 **How does it work exactly?**

Super straightforward:

* **Step 1 (We grab data):**
  We pull conversations directly from popular Reddit communities—everything from tech gadgets and productivity apps to cooking tools and personal finance.

* **Step 2 (We let AI do its thing):**
  Our AI analyzes these conversations, detects recurring problems and complaints, and measures how big or frequent each problem is.

* **Step 3 (Turn problems into opportunities):**
  The tool automatically suggests business ideas or product concepts based on these problems. Like if hundreds of users complain that "all fitness apps are way too complicated," we instantly suggest an opportunity—like a super-simple fitness tracker app designed specifically for casual users.

* **Step 4 (Make it actionable):**
  We give clear, straightforward insights, along with some numbers (how big the potential market is, how annoyed people really are), so you can quickly decide if it's worth your time.

### 🤔 **Who would pay for this?**

Entrepreneurs, startup founders, product managers, investors—literally anyone who wants to build something people actually need and will pay for. They pay a monthly fee (think \$50–\$100/month for individual users, more for teams), and they instantly get validated, real-world problems they can build solutions for.

### 💸 **How do we make money?**

You see stats: 3,200 users complained about this problem last month alone. Instant validation—clearly people want this solved. You start building a prototype immediately, confident that there’s already a waiting market.

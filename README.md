                - problem                                                - our solution
sellers want to find people who want's to buy their products - we're finding people who want's to buy that products in social media
sellers want to communicate and convince petential buyers    - our AI sales assistant which has an access to the seller db communicates with potential buyer and tries to convince to buy (or does whatever the buyer gives instructions)


on our platform seller can create AI sales assistant with desired instructions(how seller should talk to the client), create products list and give them descriptions (to help later AI assistant to communicate)

after that system finds potential leads in the social media, for example some post on facebook about a guy in Georgia who wants to buy an Iphone - our bot sends a comment "we're selling iphone, come and check, ask me any question - https://{seller}.deepseek/iphone-for-sale" - on this link there will be AI assistant bot with the knowledge of the product.

🚀 **Startup Pitch: noldo.ai**
**"We don't guess what users want — we know."**

---

### 💡 What’s the problem?

Every day, thousands of people vent on Reddit about products, services, and tools that frustrate them. Buried in these rants are **real pain points**, waiting to be solved. But nobody's tracking them at scale — until now.

---

### 🔍 What does noldo.ai do?

**noldo.ai is an AI-powered platform that monitors Reddit to detect, track, and analyze real user complaints and frustrations — turning them into structured, searchable pain insights.**

We don’t generate startup ideas.
We don’t offer solutions.
**We surface real-world demand signals — straight from the source.**

---

### 🔧 How it works

1. **Monitor Reddit:** We continuously scan high-signal subreddits across industries.
2. **Detect complaints:** Our AI spots and extracts user frustrations from posts and comments.
3. **Enrich insights:** Each pain point is scored by severity, momentum (how fast it’s growing), audience persona, and theme cluster.
4. **Make it usable:** Users can search, filter, analyze trends, or even get alerts when new problems emerge.

### 👥 Who is it for?

* **Startup founders** looking for the *right* problem to solve
* **Product managers** tracking what’s broken in their space
* **Researchers and VCs** scanning for unmet needs
* **Indie hackers and makers** looking for signals, not noise

---

### 🧠 What makes us different?

* We don’t do “trends.” We do *frustrations*.
* We don’t guess demand. We track it as it rises.
* We give context: **who’s complaining**, **how often**, and **how badly**.

### 🎯 The vision

**noldo.ai becomes the world’s pain radar.**
We want to be the first place builders go to understand what *actually* needs fixing — no surveys, no assumptions, just real user pain at scale.

That's noldo.ai—clear, straightforward, and immediately valuable.

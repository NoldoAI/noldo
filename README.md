# SeekDeep

## Short Description
SeekDeep is an AI-powered platform that connects sellers with potential buyers by automating lead generation and sales communication. Sellers can create AI sales assistants to engage buyers on social media, while buyers can use SeekDeep to find the best deals and set alerts for specific products and prices.

## Problem
- **Sellers** want to find people who want to buy their products.
- **Sellers** want to communicate and convince potential buyers.

## Our Solution
- **Finding Buyers**: We identify people who want to buy specific products on social media.
- **AI Sales Assistant**: Our AI sales assistant, which has access to the seller's database, communicates with potential buyers and tries to convince them to make a purchase (or follows any other instructions provided by the seller).

## Platform Features for Sellers
- **Create AI Sales Assistant**: Sellers can create an AI sales assistant with specific instructions on how to communicate with clients.
- **Product List & Descriptions**: Sellers can create a list of products and provide descriptions to help the AI assistant communicate effectively.

## Lead Generation
- **Social Media Monitoring**: The system identifies potential leads on social media. For example, if someone posts on Facebook about wanting to buy an iPhone in Georgia, our bot will send a comment like: 
  > "We're selling iPhones, come and check, ask me any questions - https://{seller}.deepseek/iphone-for-sale"
  
  On this link, the buyer will interact with the AI assistant bot that has knowledge about the product.

## Platform Features for Buyers
- **Monitoring Seller Websites**: We constantly monitor sellers' websites, such as those selling electronics, and save their data.
- **SeekDeep Chat**: Buyers can use the SeekDeep chat to ask for products. For example:
  > "I'm in Georgia and I want to buy a Mac Pro."
  
  The AI will provide links and options from sellers and social media.
- **Alerts**: Buyers can set alerts for specific products and prices. For example:
  > "If someone lists an iPhone 15 under 2000 Lari, send me an alert."

**Summary of Seeky**

Seeky is a comprehensive platform designed to connect buyers and sellers, offering two primary components:

1. **Seeky.chat**  
   - **Interactive Consultation:** Acts as more than a simple product suggestor by providing in-depth, detailed knowledgeâ€”especially for tech products. It functions as a true consultant, helping users find exactly what they need.  
   - **Advanced Query Breakdown:** Capable of parsing complex queries such as "I want a laptop for a student," breaking down the request, and offering tailored recommendations.  
   - **Local Store Integration:** Provides product suggestions available in local (e.g., Georgian) stores.  

2. **Seeky.app**  
   - **Market Insights:** Leverages data from Seeky.chat to deliver actionable insights about consumer interests and trends.  
   - **Lead Generation:** A key feature is generating leads not only from direct interactions on Seeky.chat but also from social media channels, such as matching buyers who express interest in products on social media groups.  
   - **Business Integration:** Businesses can upload their product databases to enhance lead matching and improve the accuracy of recommendations.  

Overall, Seeky bridges the gap between consumer needs and business offerings by combining sophisticated product consultation with powerful market intelligence and lead generation capabilities.
